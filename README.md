# Employee Management System

## Description
As a small business owner, my business is growing and I need an organization system to help keep track of my employees. Many management systems are too complicated for a small business and too expensive. Thus I decided to program my own system that fits my needs.

Through this project, I learned more skills for using Inquirer to create more dynamic prompts. I also learned how to create and edit databases using MySQL.
